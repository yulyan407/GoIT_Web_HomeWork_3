Many people have a folder on their desktop called something like "Disassemble". As a rule, hands never manage to disassemble this folder. 
Therefore, for your convenience, this script has been developed that will parse this folder. 
This application checks the file extension (the last characters in the file name) and, depending on the extension, decides which category to assign the file to. 
The script takes one argument at startup â€” the name of the folder in which it will sort. 
The file with the program is called sort.py, then to sort the /user/Desktop/Junk folder, you need to run the script with the command python sort.py /user/Desktop/Junk
